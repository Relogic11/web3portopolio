  bio: "My journey into technology began when I was just 9 years old, driven by an insatiable curiosity about how things work and a desire to create something meaningful. What started as simple HTML pages quickly evolved into a passion for solving complex problems through code. By age 12, I had built my first neural network using Python and NumPy - not because I understood all the math, but because I was fascinated by the idea of machines that could learn.\n\nThroughout my teenage years, I immersed myself in every programming language I could find. Late nights were spent reading documentation, debugging code, and building projects that no one asked for but that taught me invaluable lessons. I won several national programming competitions, not just for the recognition, but because they pushed me to think differently and solve problems under pressure.\n\nThe transition from hobby to profession wasn't just about mastering technology - it was about understanding that great software serves people, not the other way around. This philosophy has guided every project I've undertaken, from building trading bots that handle millions in transactions to creating simple POS systems for local warung owners.\n\nToday, I lead a specialized team of 4 experts: an AI/ML Engineer, Blockchain Developer, Full-Stack Developer, and Mobile/IoT Specialist. Together, we bridge the gap between cutting-edge innovation and real-world business needs. Whether it's implementing quantum-safe cryptography for security firms or building e-commerce platforms for local businesses, the core mission remains the same: use technology to create meaningful impact.\n\nWhat drives me most is the continuous learning curve. Technology evolves rapidly, and staying ahead means never stopping to learn. Every project teaches something new, every challenge demands creative solutions, and every client brings unique perspectives that expand my understanding. This isn't just work - it's a never-ending journey of growth, innovation, and problem-solving that gets more exciting with each passing year.",
