# 🚀 Free Deployment Setup Guide

## Option 1: GitHub Pages (Recommended - Completely Free!)

### Setup Steps:

   - Go to your repo settings: `https://github.com/Relogic11/web3portopolio/settings`
   - Scroll down to "Pages" section
   - Source: Select "GitHub Actions"
   - Save

2. **Push your code**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add GitHub Pages deployment workflow"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Option 2: Vercel (Alternative - Also Free!)

### Setup Steps:

2. **Import Project**: 
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your `web3portopolio` repository
   - Set root directory to `frontend`
   - Deploy!

3. **For GitHub Actions Integration** (Optional):
   - Get your tokens from Vercel dashboard
   - Add secrets in GitHub repo settings:
     - `VERCEL_TOKEN`
     - `ORG_ID` 
     - `PROJECT_ID`

## 🎯 Which Should You Choose?

**Choose GitHub Pages if**:
- You want the simplest setup
- You don't mind the slightly longer URL
- You want everything managed in one place

**Choose Vercel if**:
- You want the best performance
- You want a cleaner URL (yourproject.vercel.app)
- You plan to add more advanced features later

## 🔧 Current Workflow Status

I've set up both workflows:
- ✅ `deploy.yml` - GitHub Pages deployment
- ✅ `vercel-deploy.yml` - Vercel deployment (disabled by default)

The GitHub Pages workflow will run automatically when you push to main branch!

## 🏗️ Build Configuration

Your project is configured to:
- Build from the `frontend` directory
- Use Yarn for package management
- Deploy static files to GitHub Pages
- Support custom domain later if needed

Just push your code and watch the magic happen! 🎉
